        Industry-standard options pricing relies on the Black-Scholes formula,
        $$C = N(d_1)S_t-N(d_2)K e^{-r(T-t)}$$
        $$\rm{for}\ d_1=\frac{\ln{S_t/K}+\left(r+\sigma^2/2\right)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{(T-t)}}$$
        $$\rm{and}\ d_2=d_1-\sigma\sqrt{T-t}$$
          the solution to the Black-Scholes equation for a European option under
          the assumption of constant implied volatility and a constant risk-free
          rate. Another approach to options pricing utilizes binomial trees, but
          these models traditionally assume constant volatility and risk-free 
         interest rate as well. This app prices options with a binomial tree and
          variable implied volatility. These variable volatilities are predicted
          by a model trained on historical variability data and Black-Scholes 
         input variables (underlying stock price, risk-free interest rate, market
          price of the option, strike price, and time to expiration). More advanced
          models are under development, trained on news sentiment analysis and past
          implied volatility data.
