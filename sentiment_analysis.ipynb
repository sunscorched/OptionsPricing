The turnover ended at five Stafford’s career best streak of games without an interception.\\n\\n“I thought Matthew was efficient in the pass game,” coach Sean McVay said.\\n\\nStafford, a 16th-year pro, has passed for 20 touchdowns, with eight interceptions.\\n\\nRodgers completed 28 of 42 passes for 256 yards and a touchdown. He lost a fumble that led to Stafford’s touchdown pass to Higbee.\\n\\nOffensive line continues solid play\\n\\nFor the third game in a row, the Rams offensive line did not give up a sack.\\n\\nLeft tackle Alaric Jackson, left guard Steve Avila, center Beaux Limmer, right guard Kevin Dotson and right tackle Rob Havenstein kept Stafford upright and cleared the way for Kyren Williams to rush for 122 yards in 23 carries.\\n\\nWilliams rushed for more than 100 yards for the second game in a row.\\n\\n“Every time he steps on the grass, he’s a guy that loves to compete,” Stafford said. “We have quite a few guys on the offense that love to do it like that. It’s fun to be around him, but when he gets rolling and cooking like he was today, man, it’s a lot of fun.”\\n\\nRams defense tough on fourth downs\\n\\nRams linebacker Omar Speights and cornerbacks Ahkello Witherspoon and Darious Williams made huge plays that foiled fourth-down attempts by the Jets.\\n\\nIn the second quarter, Speights stopped running back Breece Hall for no gain, setting up Williams’ touchdown run.\\n\\nIn the third quarter, Witherspoon broke up a pass intended for Davante Adams in the end zone, giving the Rams the ball for a drive that ended with a field goal.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter, Darious Williams broke up a pass that set up another field goal.\\n\\nCooper Kupp catches on again\\n\\nReceiver Cooper Kupp bounced back from a no-catch performance against the San Francisco 49ers with three catches for 24 yards against the Jets.\\n\\nPuka Nacua caught eight passes for 56 yards. Tutu Atwell had one catch for 12 yards and Higbee’s lone catch resulted in the go-ahead touchdown.\\n\\nReceiver Demarcus Robinson did not have a catch for the second game in a row.\\n\\nJoshua Karty comes back from missed PAT\\n\\nRams kicker Joshua Karty’s day did not start well.\\n\\nAfter the Rams scored a touchdown to tie the score, 6-6, Karty missed the extra-point attempt.\\n\\nBut Karty came back and kicked field goals from 38 and 45 yards in the fourth quarter.\\n\\n“It was awesome to see Josh Karty respond the way that he did,” McVay said.\\n\\nKarty has made 23 of 28 field-goal attempts and 29 of 33 extra points.'"
